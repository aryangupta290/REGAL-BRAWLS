# OOPS Principles 

## Inheritence
* The Building class serves as the base class, from which the Town Hall, Wall, Cannon ,Wizard and Hut classes inherit.  
* The King ,Queen , Archer , Balloon and Barbarian classes inherit from the Troops class.  

## Abstraction 

 ```move()``` and ```attack()``` methods of the Troop class are two examples of Abstraction . The inner details and implementation of movement and attacking are hidden from the user and the user can directly use these functions without bothering about their internal implementation . 
 
 ## Encapsulation 
 To realise Encapsulation , all functions or variables pertaining to a particular game entity are grouped under a single class.Then, all that is required to use the feature is to call the method on the class object.  
 
 ## Polymorphism 
The Troop class has an ```attack()``` method.The Queen class has its specific ```attack()``` method that overrides the default Troop's ```attack()``` method.
